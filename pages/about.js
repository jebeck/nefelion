          nearly all‚Äîdata being gathered by all these devices, but it&#39;s not
          a very <em>accessible</em> repository. There&#39;s no REST API; in

          SDK from a native application installed and running on the data

            Gyroscope
          </a>, which (in the Pro version) aggregates a user&#39;s entire

            RescueTime

          reviewing data both from a detailed, daily perspective and across
          longer timespans.

        <p>
          But Gyroscope doesn&#39;t integrate diabetes data; this isn&#39;t a
          surprise given the rarity of type 1 diabetes. So I&#39;m left back at
          square one, and the only true solution left for me to store and view
          my data in the ways <strong>I</strong> want to is to build my own
          solution.

          many of the other (big) cloud applications in wide use today (e.g.,
          Google, Facebook, Dropbox, &amp;c), but tailored exactly to my needs
          and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, before I leave my reader (whoever you are{' '}
          <span role="img" aria-label="wink emoji">
            üòâ
          </span>) with too much of an impression that the driving force behind
          this project is the <em>failure</em> of other projects to meet my
          needs and desires, let me explain further.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am an engineer, both as my day job and at{' '}
          <span role="img" aria-label="red heart emoji">
            ‚ù§Ô∏è
          </span>. I <strong>like</strong> to build things; in fact, I{' '}
          <em>thrive</em> on it. So a great deal of the motivation here is the
          pleasure of the building itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&#39;s also the freedom to experiment and change things as
          frequently as I desire. Anyone who has been an early adopter of a
          Minimum Viable Product piece of software (or hardware) knows the pain
          of waiting...
        </p>
        <p>...waiting</p>
        <p>...and (moar) waiting...</p>
        <p>
          ...for the single killer feature that‚Äôs going to make the product fit
          into your life in exactly the way you want it to. With nefelion I
          still have to wait for features, but I‚Äôm in control of the waiting
          because I‚Äôm in control of the building!
